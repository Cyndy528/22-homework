  <ol class="questions">
  	<li>I don't understand how class and id work in the syntax</li>
  	<li>The questions use totally different language to what we'd been working with, eg. what does this actually mean?: 
  Make an inline element with a class of "strike" that "strikes out" the font inside of it.</li>
  	<li>Generally understand the structure and elements of HTML; less comfortable with the CSS syntax</li>
  </ol>
