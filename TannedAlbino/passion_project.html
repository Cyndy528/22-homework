	<p>My passion project for this course and beyond is creating OLED fingernails that change styles and images through an app.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I am going to find many ways that don't work before I find ones that do.</li>

	<li>Always focus on the end, and remember there are many ways to get to the same place.</li>
</ul>
