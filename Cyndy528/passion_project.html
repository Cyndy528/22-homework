	My Passion Project is creating an educational crowdsourcing platform that enables individual donors to directly fund educational costs in developing countries without access to affordable schooling. I will need to partner with Educational Partners in these countries, who will identify the students who need educational funds. After this, they can send a profile of the student to my organization. After the donation has been provided, the Educational Partner will send an update of the student's progress. All donations will be 100% towards educational costs, and I plan on getting funds through seed funding to cover company costs and overhead.
