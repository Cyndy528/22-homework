	<p>  I would like one of my project's at General Assembly to be an e-commerce site dedicated to my sister Margo who passed away this summmer.  She was a graphic designer, lover of color, and a had a passion for building, and making things.  Her brand was called margomade.  I would love to build a site where I can sell or donate some of the beautiful things she left behing, and possibly inspire others to create themselves.
