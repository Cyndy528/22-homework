  <h2>My Passion Project</h2>
  <p>
  One passion project I would like to one day complete would be to allow for
  people to annotate and comment on current legislation under consideration.
  It would, in my ideal world, allow for things like loopholes, riders and pork
  to be fished out by the crowd. Also, people could comment and submit updates
  to various aspects of the legistlation ala github push/pull requests. anything
  that allows for better government between the people and their elected representatives
  is worthwhile to me. With the skills I will learn in WDI I will implement this idea.

  <h2>Some pieces of advice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Success is a state of mind.</li>
    <li>There are almost always many different approaches to a particular problem, with no single “right way.”</li>
    <li>Sticking with it is more important than the method.</li>
    <li>Testing git</li>
  </ul>
