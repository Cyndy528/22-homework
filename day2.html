        <h1>On seeking pleasure</h1>
        <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</p>

        <h1>On seeking pain</h1>
        <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.</p>

    <h2>Questions on the left</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>What exactly does the offset do in the class segment?</li>
        <li>why put the "." in front of "container" and "row" classes? I understand it's to create a grid, but what does that mean?</li>
        <li>how can we enable the dropdown navbar? will we learn that process?</li> 
        <li>ran into some problems with the exercises on linked dev sites. couldn't find the way to try and test operations that showed up there, to figure out what they do in repl.it such as "x++"" and switch/case. I can't understand that one for the life of me.</li>

    <h2>Treasures for the future on the right</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Funke videos were really helpful for me. Relearned the loop sysntax, how functions and loops process information and evaluate expressions. I will deffinitely watch the rest of the posted episodes</li>
        <li>Also from the videos, I got a better grasp of booleans, in particular double arguments(?) such as "&&" and "||" which I struggled with before.</li>
        <li>The keyboard shortcuts are great! I'm not at all a native Mac user, so finding ways to expedite my performance was greatly needed. I'm really looking forward to careening about the UI like a bat out of hell. :-D</li>
