	<p>I'm interested in building a web-based game that can run on an ipad.  It is to teach toddlers perfect pitch with the methods outlined in recent research.  The game will entail specific flashing colors according to the note being played.  Interactivity is a little more difficult, but it would be neat if the game also accepted imput and played notes according to what colored buttons were touched.</p>

		<li>When it comes to coding, patience and persistence are virtues</li>
		<li>Acting like you know things that you don't will only hold you back..</li>
		<li>Understand that being a great coder takes time more than anything else. Those who practice the most will come out more skilled.</li>
