			<p>I would love to create a mobile/web application that will replicate the event planning/invitation aspect of Facebook. I believe Facebook's entertainment value has dwindled enormously, especially for young to middle-age adults. Facebook's main, or perhaps sole, utility remains as a means to notify acquaintances and friends of events, shows, parties, etc. This app would replicate and refine this utility. Initially, I believe that the app would be very useful for small groups of friends who frequent the same social gatherings. Instead of endless webs of texting between mutual friends on a Friday night, users will be able to broadcast their plans for the evening to an audience of their choosing. As the userbase for the app increases, event organizers and venues would benefit from broadcasting their events on this platform as a marketing/advertising strategy. </p>
			<p>Some Advice...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the app must serve a very precise purpose, at least initially, in order to potentially succeed.</li>
				<li>make sure that there is a need/demand for your app.</li>
				<li>don't be afraid to go back to the drawing board.</li>
			</ul>
