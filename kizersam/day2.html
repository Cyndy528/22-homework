          <li>I don't really understand what the RegExp section in the first file is trying to teach us.</li>

          <li>I will definitely start using a lot of the commands shortcuts for sublime such as ALT to scroll across words. </li>
          <li> Another one I really liked was Command Shift to highlight entire lines.</li>
          <li> Also Command D to find and edit multiple instances of the same words at once. </li>
