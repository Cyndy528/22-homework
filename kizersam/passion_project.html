			I would like to build a website to serve as an online marketplace for the wholesale of different raw materials. It would primarily focus on connecting buyers and sellers in Latin America and Asia. Though it will primarily focus on  industrial and agricultural goods, it should also be flexible enough to allow the wholesale of finished and retail-ready products.
