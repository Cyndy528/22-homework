						<p>It seems weird to me that the specificity of the variable can depend on whether or not you declared it? And that they are all vars? Coming from java (unless I just did java entirely incorrectly) this just rubs me the wrong way, and while this isn't really a question I'm ending it with a question mark to convey my confused intonation?</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>What kind of errors can happen with callback functions? The seem really easily breakable, but I guess this is why everything is var instead of specific?</p>
					</li>

						<p>Wait so classes are variables too!?!?!?! The reading about .this thoroughly confused me I'll ask about it during squad tomorrow</p>

					<p>The sublime shortcuts will also be very useful. Someone mentioned there being a list of them? It would be nice to see at least the useful ones written out. </p>

					<p>I understand this is useful confirmation to reflect on what I just read and I did read it but I honestly can't think of another thing that isn't just painstakingly obvious, hopefully you won't read this and judge me... </p>
