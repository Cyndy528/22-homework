	<p>As a formal project or as a side project I am very excited to build a website for my friend's buisness. My best friend, Michelle, is a makeup artist and a hairstylist who does not yet have a website containing her portfolio and contact information. Her work is phenomenal and I believe a personal website is exactly the next step she needs to take in order to grow her brand. I'm ecstatic to create something that will be functional, creative, and that I can continue to build on over time. Most importantly, I'm thrilled to be helping my best friend by making a site that will help grow her business.

		<li>The video explaning growth mindset was inspiring to me (as I tend to be someone with a fixed mindset) and will encourage me to keep growing and keep trying.</li>
		<li>The article about perserverence is a similar viewpoint to that of growth mindset, stated in a more obvious way. The analogy "if you keep stacking bricks you'll eventually have a wall" is a helpful way of thinking. If you're feeling defeated, it just means you're ready to stack a new brick.</li>
		<li>The CSS introduction contained good information on how to structure a website and code using "better practices". Keeping your code formatted and clean from the start will help to avoid issues in the future.</li>
