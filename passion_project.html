<h1>PASSION PROJECT</h1>

<p>
So there on day one, as Alex was giving his lecture on server/client relations, he off-handedly mentioned it was possible to convert a pc into a working server, and how'd he'd had it on his back-burner for a while. 
</p>


<p>
This may be of limited value, from a functionality perspective, but it got my attention. This is a bit of a leap for a day-one student of WDI, but I was going to ask him about it, and see if he could use an apprentice with it, or perhaps give pointers to someone(s) engaging in such a pursuit. 
</p>

<p>
I've always been fascinated with the realm where hardware meets software, and it may be a task for off from where I currently find myself, but I believe it has potential to be a powerful learning experience, and interesting project, and potentially a fun activity of discovery. Learning has always been my greatest passion, and plunging into new territory has not been far behind it. Thus equipped, and forearmed with the resources this class promises to give me, I think it could a worthy pursuit.

The video and blog were both touching, each in their own way. The TedTalk, I think, was very profound, and had farther reaching implications for us as individuals, and even as a society. The word inspiring comes to mind. The blog had a similar effect, but focused more on ideas like identity, as we see in ourselves as well as those around us.
</p>

The best things I found in both are listed below, submitted for your consideration:

<ul>
	<li>The idea that the mind is so malleable, and even impressionable, reinforces the importance of positivity, both with the world around us, and our internal selves.
	<li>The effects of our perspective profoundly effect our ability to adapt to stressful environemnts and situations. Again, positivity is important.
	<li>The importances of taking defeat with grace, with humility, and understanding a defeat does not have to be an end. It can just be a learning experience, a disenchantment, or a lesson.


</ul>

I know you asked for one list of three, and one praragraph, but I feel Ms Carver deserves to be represented in this declaration of intent as well.

<ul>
	<li>The importance of putting your own interests and needs above the expectations of others.
	<li>The fine line between doing things your own way out of utility, or ignorance. That standards have a place for a reason, but are not always applicable.
	<li>Perserverence, and refusal to accept defeat with anything less than aplomb.
</ul>
